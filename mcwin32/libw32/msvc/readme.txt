        This project fills the absence of stdint.h and inttypes.h in Microsoft
        Visual Studio. This files were standartized by ISO/IEC as a part of C99
        standard library. If you want to compile or use C99 compliant project
        with Microsoft Visual Studio, you will likely find that you're missing
        these headers. Note though, that just adding these header does not make
        Visual Studio compiler fully C99 compliant.
