//  NAME
//      chown - change owner and group of a file
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//      #include <unistd.h>
//
//      int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//      The chown() function shall change the user and group ownership of a file.
//
//      The path argument points to a pathname naming a file. The user ID and group ID of
//      the named file shall be set to the numeric values contained in owner and group,
//      respectively.
//
//      Only processes with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or with
//      appropriate privileges may change the ownership of a file. If
//      _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for path:
//
//          Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with appropriate privileges.
//
//          Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with an effective user ID equal
//          to the user ID of the file, but without appropriate privileges, if and only if
//          owner is equal to the file's user ID or ( uid_t)-1 and group is equal either to
//          the calling process' effective group ID or to one of its supplementary group IDs.
//
//      If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or
//      S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process does not have appropriate
//      privileges, the set-user-ID (S_ISUID) and set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file
//      mode shall be cleared upon successful return from chown(). If the specified file is
//      a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file
//      mode are set, and the process has appropriate privileges, it is
//      implementation-defined whether the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are altered.
//      If the chown() function is successfully invoked on a file that is not a regular
//      file and one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are
//      set, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits may be cleared.
//
//      If owner or group is specified as ( uid_t)-1 or ( gid_t)-1, respectively, the
//      corresponding ID of the file shall not be changed. If both owner and group are -1,
//      the times need not be updated.
//
//      Upon successful completion, chown() shall mark for update the st_ctime field of the
//      file.
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be returned
//      and errno set to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no changes are made in the
//      user ID and group ID of the file.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      The chown() function shall fail if:
//
//      [EACCES]
//          Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
//
//      [ELOOP]
//          A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path
//          argument.
//
//      [ENAMETOOLONG]
//          The length of the path argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is
//          longer than {NAME_MAX}.
//
//      [ENOTDIR]
//          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
//
//      [ENOENT]
//          A component of path does not name an existing file or path is an empty string.
//
//      [EPERM]
//          The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file, or the calling
//          process does not have appropriate privileges and _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
//          indicates that such privilege is required.
//
//      [EROFS]
//          The named file resides on a read-only file system.
//
//      The chown() function may fail if:
//
//      [EIO]
//          An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to the file system.
//
//      [EINTR]
//          The chown() function was interrupted by a signal which was caught.
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The owner or group ID supplied is not a value supported by the implementation.
//
//      [ELOOP]
//          More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of
//          the path argument.
//
//      [ENAMETOOLONG]
//          As a result of encountering a symbolic link in resolution of the path argument,
//          the length of the substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.
