//  NAME
//      pread, read - read from a file
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//
//      #include <unistd.h>
//
//      ssize_t pread(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte, off_t offset);
//      ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//
//      The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with
//      the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf. The behavior
//      of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is
//      unspecified.
//
//      Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the read()
//      function may detect and return errors as described below. In the absence of errors,
//      or if error detection is not performed, the read() function shall return zero and
//      have no other results.
//
//      On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read() shall start
//      at a position in the file given by the file offset associated with fildes. The file
//      offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually read.
//
//      Files that do not support seeking-for example, terminals-always read from the
//      current position. The value of a file offset associated with such a file is
//      undefined.
//
//      No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the starting position
//      is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned. If the file refers to a device
//      special file, the result of subsequent read() requests is implementation-defined.
//
//      If the value of nbyte is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
//      implementation-defined.
//
//      When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:
//
//          If no process has the pipe open for writing, read() shall return 0 to indicate
//          end-of-file.
//
//          If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is set, read()
//          shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].
//
//          If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is clear, read()
//          shall block the calling thread until some data is written or the pipe is closed
//          by all processes that had the pipe open for writing.
//
//      When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that supports
//      non-blocking reads and has no data currently available:
//
//          If O_NONBLOCK is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].
//
//          If O_NONBLOCK is clear, read() shall block the calling thread until some data
//          becomes available.
//
//          The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data available.
//
//      The read() function reads data previously written to a file. If any portion of a
//      regular file prior to the end-of-file has not been written, read() shall return
//      bytes with value 0. For example, lseek() allows the file offset to be set beyond
//      the end of existing data in the file. If data is later written at this point,
//      subsequent reads in the gap between the previous end of data and the newly written
//      data shall return bytes with value 0 until data is written into the gap.
//
//      Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, read() shall mark for
//      update the st_atime field of the file, and shall return the number of bytes read.
//      This number shall never be greater than nbyte. The value returned may be less than
//      nbyte if the number of bytes left in the file is less than nbyte, if the read()
//      request was interrupted by a signal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special
//      file and has fewer than nbyte bytes immediately available for reading. For example,
//      a read() from a file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of data.
//
//      If a read() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any data, it shall return -1
//      with errno set to [EINTR].
//
//      If a read() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it
//      shall return the number of bytes read.
//
//      For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established
//      in the open file description associated with fildes.
//
//      If fildes refers to a socket, read() shall be equivalent to recv() with no flags set.
//
//      If the O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file
//      descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity completion.
//      If the O_SYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file
//      descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion.
//      [Option End]
//
//      If fildes refers to a shared memory object, the result of the read() function is
//      unspecified. [Option End]
//
//      If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the read() function is
//      unspecified. [Option End]
//
//      A read() from a STREAMS file can read data in three different modes: byte-stream
//      mode, message-nondiscard mode, and message-discard mode. The default shall be
//      byte-stream mode. This can be changed using the I_SRDOPT ioctl() request, and can
//      be tested with I_GRDOPT ioctl(). In byte-stream mode, read() shall retrieve data
//      from the STREAM until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until
//      there is no more data to be retrieved. Byte-stream mode ignores message boundaries.
//
//      In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, read() shall retrieve data until as many bytes
//      as were requested are transferred, or until a message boundary is reached. If
//      read() does not retrieve all the data in a message, the remaining data shall be
//      left on the STREAM, and can be retrieved by the next read() call. Message-discard
//      mode also retrieves data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or
//      a message boundary is reached. However, unread data remaining in a message after
//      the read() returns shall be discarded, and shall not be available for a subsequent
//      read(), getmsg(), or getpmsg() call.
//
//      How read() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by the current read
//      mode setting. In byte-stream mode, read() shall accept data until it has read nbyte
//      bytes, or until there is no more data to read, or until a zero-byte message block
//      is encountered. The read() function shall then return the number of bytes read, and
//      place the zero-byte message back on the STREAM to be retrieved by the next read(),
//      getmsg(), or getpmsg(). In message-nondiscard mode or message-discard mode, a
//      zero-byte message shall return 0 and the message shall be removed from the STREAM.
//      When a zero-byte message is read as the first message on a STREAM, the message
//      shall be removed from the STREAM and 0 shall be returned, regardless of the read
//      mode.
//
//      A read() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message at the front of
//      the STREAM head read queue, regardless of the priority band of the message.
//
//      By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a read() from a STREAMS
//      file can only process messages that contain a data part but do not contain a
//      control part. The read() shall fail if a message containing a control part is
//      encountered at the STREAM head. This default action can be changed by placing the
//      STREAM in either control-data mode or control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT
//      ioctl() command. In control-data mode, read() shall convert any control part to
//      data and pass it to the application before passing any data part originally present
//      in the same message. In control-discard mode, read() shall discard message control
//      parts but return to the process any data part in the message.
//
//      In addition, read() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed an asynchronous
//      error before the call. In this case, the value of errno shall not reflect the
//      result of read(), but reflect the prior error. If a hangup occurs on the STREAM
//      being read, read() shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read
//      queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0. [Option End]
//
//      The pread() function shall be equivalent to read(), except that it shall read from
//      a given position in the file without changing the file pointer. The first three
//      arguments to pread() are the same as read() with the addition of a fourth argument
//      offset for the desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a pread() on
//      a file that is incapable of seeking shall result in an error. [Option End]
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon successful completion, read() [XSI] [Option Start] and pread() [Option End]
//      shall return a non-negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read.
//      Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      The read() and [XSI] [Option Start] pread() [Option End] functions shall fail if:
//
//      [EAGAIN]
//          The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor and the thread would be
//          delayed.
//
//      [EBADF]
//          The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.
//
//      [EBADMSG]
//          The file is a STREAM file that is set to control-normal mode and the message
//          waiting to be read includes a control part. [Option End]
//
//      [EINTR]
//          The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data
//          was transferred.
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The STREAM or multiplexer referenced by fildes is linked (directly or
//          indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer. [Option End]
//
//      [EIO]
//          The process is a member of a background process attempting to read from its
//          controlling terminal, the process is ignoring or blocking the SIGTTIN signal,
//          or the process group is orphaned. This error may also be generated for
//          implementation-defined reasons.
//
//      [EISDIR]
//          The fildes argument refers to a directory and the implementation does not allow
//          the directory to be read using read() or pread(). The readdir() function should
//          be used instead. [Option End]
//
//      [EOVERFLOW]
//          The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0, the starting position is
//          before the end-of-file, and the starting position is greater than or equal to
//          the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with
//          fildes.
//
//      The read() function shall fail if:
//
//      [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK]
//          The file descriptor is for a socket, is marked O_NONBLOCK, and no data is
//          waiting to be received.
//
//      [ECONNRESET]
//          A read was attempted on a socket and the connection was forcibly closed by its
//          peer.
//
//      [ENOTCONN]
//          A read was attempted on a socket that is not connected.
//
//      [ETIMEDOUT]
//          A read was attempted on a socket and a transmission timeout occurred.
//
//      The read() and [XSI] [Option Start] pread() [Option End] functions may fail if:
//
//      [EIO]
//          A physical I/O error has occurred.
//
//      [ENOBUFS]
//          Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.
//
//      [ENOMEM]
//          Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
//
//      [ENXIO]
//          A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the
//          capabilities of the device.
//
//      The pread() function shall fail, and the file pointer shall remain unchanged, if:
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The offset argument is invalid. The value is negative. [Option End]
//
//      [EOVERFLOW]
//          The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read at or beyond the
//          offset maximum associated with the file. [Option End]
//
//      [ENXIO]
//          A request was outside the capabilities of the device. [Option End]
//
//      [ESPIPE]
//          fildes is associated with a pipe or FIFO. [Option End]
