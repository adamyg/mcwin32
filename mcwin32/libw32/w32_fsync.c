//  NAME
//      fsync - synchronize changes to a file
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//
//      #include <unistd.h>
//
//      int fsync(int fildes);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//
//      The fsync() function shall request that all data for the open file descriptor named
//      by fildes is to be transferred to the storage device associated with the file
//      described by fildes. The nature of the transfer is implementation-defined. The
//      fsync() function shall not return until the system has completed that action or
//      until an error is detected.
//
//      If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the fsync() function shall force all
//      currently queued I/O operations associated with the file indicated by file
//      descriptor fildes to the synchronized I/O completion state. All I/O operations
//      shall be completed as defined for synchronized I/O file integrity completion.
//      [Option End]
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon successful completion, fsync() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned
//      and errno set to indicate the error. If the fsync() function fails, outstanding I/O
//      operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      The fsync() function shall fail if:
//
//      [EBADF]
//          The fildes argument is not a valid descriptor.
//
//      [EINTR]
//          The fsync() function was interrupted by a signal.
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The fildes argument does not refer to a file on which this operation is possible.
//
//      [EIO]
//          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
//
//      In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail, fsync() shall return the
//      error conditions defined for read() and write().
