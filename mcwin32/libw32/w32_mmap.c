//  NAME
//  
//      mmap - map pages of memory 
//  
//  SYNOPSIS
//  
//      #include <sys/mman.h>
//  
//      void *mmap(void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, int fildes, off_t off);
//  
//  DESCRIPTION
//  
//      The mmap() function establishes a mapping between a process' address space and a
//      file or shared memory object. The format of the call is as follows:
//  
//          pa=mmap(addr, len, prot, flags, fildes, off);
//  
//      The mmap() function establishes a mapping between the address space of the process
//      at an address pa for len bytes to the memory object represented by the file
//      descriptor fildes at offset off for len bytes. The value of pa is an
//      implementation-dependent function of the parameter addr and the values of flags, 
//      further described below. A successful mmap() call returns pa as its result. The
//      address range starting at pa and continuing for len bytes will be legitimate for
//      the possible (not necessarily current) address space of the process. The range of
//      bytes starting at off and continuing for len bytes will be legitimate for the
//      possible (not necessarily current) offsets in the file or shared memory object
//      represented by fildes.
//  
//      The mapping established by mmap() replaces any previous mappings for those whole
//      pages containing any part of the address space of the process starting at pa and
//      continuing for len bytes.
//  
//      If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to mmap() as a result of some
//      other operation on the mapped file, the effect of references to portions of the
//      mapped region that correspond to added or removed portions of the file is
//      unspecified.
//  
//      The mmap() function is supported for regular files and shared memory objects.
//      Support for any other type of file is unspecified.
//  
//      The parameter prot determines whether read, write, execute, or some combination of
//      accesses are permitted to the data being mapped. The prot should be either
//      PROT_NONE or the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the other flags in the
//      following table, defined in the header <sys/mman.h>.
//  
//          Symbolic Constant 	Description
//          PROT_READ 	        Data can be read.
//          PROT_WRITE 	        Data can be written.
//          PROT_EXEC 	        Data can be executed.
//          PROT_NONE 	        Data cannot be accessed.
//  
//      If an implementation cannot support the combination of access types specified by
//      prot, the call to mmap() fails. An implementation may permit accesses other than
//      those specified by prot; however, the implementation will not permit a write to
//      succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set or permit any access where PROT_NONE
//      alone has been set. The implementation will support at least the following values
//      of prot: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the inclusive OR of PROT_READ and
//      PROT_WRITE. The file descriptor fildes will have been opened with read permission, 
//      regardless of the protection options specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified, the
//      application must have opened the file descriptor fildes with write permission
//      unless MAP_PRIVATE is specified in the flags parameter as described below.
//  
//      The parameter flags provides other information about the handling of the mapped
//      data. The value of flags is the bitwise inclusive OR of these options, defined in
//      <sys/mman.h>:
//  
//          Symbolic Constant 	Description
//          MAP_SHARED 	        Changes are shared.
//          MAP_PRIVATE         Changes are private.
//          MAP_FIXED 	        Interpret addr exactly.
//  
//      MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of write references to the
//      memory object. If MAP_SHARED is specified, write references change the underlying
//      object. If MAP_PRIVATE is specified, modifications to the mapped data by the
//      calling process will be visible only to the calling process and will not change the
//      underlying object. It is unspecified whether modifications to the underlying object
//      done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the
//      MAP_PRIVATE mapping. Either MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not
//      both. The mapping type is retained across fork().
//  
//      When MAP_FIXED is set in the flags argument, the implementation is informed that
//      the value of pa must be addr, exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, mmap() may return
//      MAP_FAILED and set errno to [EINVAL]. If a MAP_FIXED request is successful, the
//      mapping established by mmap() replaces any previous mappings for the process' pages
//      in the range [pa, pa + len).
//  
//      When MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses addr in an unspecified manner to
//      arrive at pa. The pa so chosen will be an area of the address space that the
//      implementation deems suitable for a mapping of len bytes to the file. All
//      implementations interpret an addr value of 0 as granting the implementation
//      complete freedom in selecting pa, subject to constraints described below. A
//      non-zero value of addr is taken to be a suggestion of a process address near which
//      the mapping should be placed. When the implementation selects a value for pa, it
//      never places a mapping at address 0, nor does it replace any extant mapping.
//  
//      The off argument is constrained to be aligned and sized according to the value
//      returned by sysconf() when passed _SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. When MAP_FIXED is
//      specified, the argument addr must also meet these constraints. The implementation
//      performs mapping operations over whole pages. Thus, while the argument len need not
//      meet a size or alignment constraint, the implementation will include, in any
//      mapping operation, any partial page specified by the range [pa, pa + len).
//  
//      The system always zero-fills any partial page at the end of an object. Further, the
//      system never writes out any modified portions of the last page of an object that
//      are beyond its end. References within the address range starting at pa and
//      continuing for len bytes to whole pages following the end of an object result in
//      delivery of a SIGBUS signal.
//  
//      An implementation may deliver SIGBUS signals when a reference would cause an error
//      in the mapped object, such as out-of-space condition.
//  
//      The mmap() function adds an extra reference to the file associated with the file
//      descriptor fildes which is not removed by a subsequent close() on that file
//      descriptor. This reference is removed when there are no more mappings to the file.
//  
//      The st_atime field of the mapped file may be marked for update at any time between
//      the mmap() call and the corresponding munmap() call. The initial read or write
//      reference to a mapped region will cause the file's st_atime field to be marked for
//      update if it has not already been marked for update.
//  
//      The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of a file that is mapped with MAP_SHARED and
//      PROT_WRITE, will be marked for update at some point in the interval between a write
//      reference to the mapped region and the next call to msync() with MS_ASYNC or
//      MS_SYNC for that portion of the file by any process. If there is no such call, 
//      these fields may be marked for update at any time after a write reference if the
//      underlying file is modified as a result.
//  
//      There may be implementation-dependent limits on the number of memory regions that
//      can be mapped (per process or per system). If such a limit is imposed, whether the
//      number of memory regions that can be mapped by a process is decreased by the use of
//      shmat() is implementation-dependent.
//  
//   RETURN VALUE
//  
//      Upon successful completion, the mmap() function returns the address at which the
//      mapping was placed (pa); otherwise, it returns a value of MAP_FAILED and sets errno
//      to indicate the error. The symbol MAP_FAILED is defined in the header <sys/mman.h>.
//      No successful return from mmap() will return the value MAP_FAILED.
//  
//      If mmap() fails for reasons other than [EBADF], [EINVAL] or [ENOTSUP], some of the
//      mappings in the address range starting at addr and continuing for len bytes may
//      have been unmapped.
//  
//   ERRORS
//  
//      The mmap() function will fail if:
//  
//      [EACCES]
//          The fildes argument is not open for read, regardless of the protection
//          specified, or fildes is not open for write and PROT_WRITE was specified for a
//          MAP_SHARED type mapping.
//  
//      [EAGAIN]
//          The mapping could not be locked in memory, if required by mlockall(), due to a
//          lack of resources.
//  
//      [EBADF]
//          The fildes argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
//  
//      [EINVAL]
//          The addr argument (if MAP_FIXED was specified) or off is not a multiple of the
//          page size as returned by sysconf(), or are considered invalid by the
//          implementation.
//  
//      [EINVAL]
//          The value of flags is invalid (neither MAP_PRIVATE nor MAP_SHARED is set).
//  
//      [EMFILE]
//          The number of mapped regions would exceed an implementation-dependent limit
//          (per process or per system).
//  
//      [ENODEV]
//          The fildes argument refers to a file whose type is not supported by mmap().
//  
//      [ENOMEM]
//          MAP_FIXED was specified, and the range [addr, addr + len) exceeds that allowed
//          for the address space of a process; or if MAP_FIXED was not specified and there
//          is insufficient room in the address space to effect the mapping.
//      
//      [ENOMEM]
//          The mapping could not be locked in memory, if required by mlockall(), because
//          it would require more space than the system is able to supply.
//  
//      [ENOTSUP]
//          The implementation does not support the combination of accesses requested in the prot argument. 
//      
//      [ENXIO]
//          Addresses in the range [off, off + len) are invalid for the object specified by fildes. 
//      
//      [ENXIO]
//          MAP_FIXED was specified in flags and the combination of addr, len and off is
//          invalid for the object specified by fildes.
//  
//      [EOVERFLOW]
//          The file is a regular file and the value of off plus len exceeds the offset
//          maximum established in the open file description associated with fildes.
//  
//   EXAMPLES
//      None.

//  NAME
//      mprotect - set protection of memory mapping 
//  
//  SYNOPSIS
//      #include <sys/mman.h>
//  
//      int mprotect(void *addr, size_t len, int prot);
//  
//  DESCRIPTION
//      The function mprotect() changes the access protections to be that specified by prot
//      for those whole pages containing any part of the address space of the process
//      starting at address addr and continuing for len bytes. The parameter prot
//      determines whether read, write, execute, or some combination of accesses are
//      permitted to the data being mapped. The prot argument should be either PROT_NONE or
//      the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC.
//  
//      If an implementation cannot support the combination of access types specified by
//      prot, the call to mprotect() fails.
//  
//      An implementation may permit accesses other than those specified by prot; however, 
//      no implementation permits a write to succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set or
//      permits any access where PROT_NONE alone has been set. Implementations will support
//      at least the following values of prot: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the
//      inclusive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE. If PROT_WRITE is specified, the
//      application must have opened the mapped objects in the specified address range with
//      write permission, unless MAP_PRIVATE was specified in the original mapping, 
//      regardless of whether the file descriptors used to map the objects have since been
//      closed.
//  
//      The implementation will require that addr be a multiple of the page size as
//      returned by sysconf().
//  
//      The behaviour of this function is unspecified if the mapping was not established by
//      a call to mmap().
//  
//      When mprotect() fails for reasons other than [EINVAL], the protections on some of
//      the pages in the range [addr, addr + len) may have been changed.
//  
//  RETURN VALUE
//      Upon successful completion, mprotect() returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets
//      errno to indicate the error.
//  
//  ERRORS
//  
//      The mprotect() function will fail if:
//  
//      [EACCES]
//          The prot argument specifies a protection that violates the access permission
//          the process has to the underlying memory object.
//  
//      [EAGAIN]
//          The prot argument specifies PROT_WRITE over a MAP_PRIVATE mapping and there are
//          insufficient memory resources to reserve for locking the private page.

//  NAME
//      msync - synchronize memory with physical storage
//      
//  SYNOPSIS
//      #include <sys/mman.h>
//          
//      int msync(void *addr, size_t len, int flags);
//              
//  DESCRIPTION
//      The msync() function shall write all modified data to permanent storage locations,
//      if any, in those whole pages containing any part of the address space of the
//      process starting at address addr and continuing for len bytes. If no such storage
//      exists, msync() need not have any effect. If requested, the msync() function shall
//      then invalidate cached copies of data.
//
//      The implementation shall require that addr be a multiple of the page size as returned
//      by sysconf().
//
//      For mappings to files, the msync() function shall ensure that all write operations
//      are completed as defined for synchronized I/O data integrity completion. It is
//      unspecified whether the implementation also writes out other file attributes. When
//      the msync() function is called on MAP_PRIVATE mappings, any modified data shall not
//      be written to the underlying object and shall not cause such data to be made
//      visible to other processes. It is unspecified whether data in MAP_PRIVATE mappings
//      has any permanent storage locations. [SHM|TYM] [Option Start] The effect of msync()
//      on a shared memory object or a typed memory object is unspecified. [Option End] The
//      behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was not established by a
//      call to mmap().
//  
//      The flags argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of
//      the following flags defined in the <sys/mman.h> header:
//  
//          Symbolic Constant           Description
//          MS_ASYNC                    Perform asynchronous writes.
//          MS_SYNC                     Perform synchronous writes.
//          MS_INVALIDATE               Invalidate cached data.
//

/*
//  NAME
//      munmap - unmap pages of memory
//  
//  SYNOPSIS
//      #include <sys/mman.h>
//  
//      int munmap(void *addr, size_t len);
//  
//  DESCRIPTION
//      The munmap() function shall remove any mappings for those entire pages containing
//      any part of the address space of the process starting at addr and continuing for
//      len bytes. Further references to these pages shall result in the generation of a
//      SIGSEGV signal to the process. If there are no mappings in the specified address
//      range, then munmap() has no effect.
//  
//      The implementation shall require that addr be a multiple of the page size {
//      PAGESIZE}.
//  
//      If a mapping to be removed was private, any modifications made in this address
//      range shall be discarded.
//  
//      [ML|MLR] [Option Start] Any memory locks (see mlock() and mlockall() ) associated
//      with this address range shall be removed, as if by an appropriate call to
//      munlock(). [Option End]
//  
//      [TYM] [Option Start] If a mapping removed from a typed memory object causes the
//      corresponding address range of the memory pool to be inaccessible by any process in
//      the system except through allocatable mappings (that is, mappings of typed memory
//      objects opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag), then that range of
//      the memory pool shall become deallocated and may become available to satisfy future
//      typed memory allocation requests.
//  
//      A mapping removed from a typed memory object opened with the
//      POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag shall not affect in any way the availability
//      of that typed memory for allocation. [Option End]
//  
//      The behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was not established by
//      a call to mmap().
//  
//  RETURN VALUE
//  
//      Upon successful completion, munmap() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1
//      and set errno to indicate the error.
//  
//  ERRORS
//  
//      The munmap() function shall fail if:
//  
//      [EINVAL]
//          Addresses in the range [addr, addr+len) are outside the valid range for the
//          address space of a process.
//  
//      [EINVAL]
//          The len argument is 0.
//  
//      [EINVAL]
//          The addr argument is not a multiple of the page size as returned by sysconf().
