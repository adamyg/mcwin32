//  NAME
//      fcntl - file control
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//
//      #include <unistd.h>
//      #include <fcntl.h>
//
//      int fcntl(int fildes, int cmd, ...);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//
//      The fcntl() function shall perform the operations described below on open files.
//      The fildes argument is a file descriptor.
//
//      The available values for cmd are defined in <fcntl.h> and are as follows:
//
//      F_DUPFD     Return a new file descriptor which shall be the lowest numbered available
//                  (that is, not already open) file descriptor greater than or equal to the third
//                  argument, arg, taken as an integer of type int. The new file descriptor shall refer
//                  to the same open file description as the original file descriptor, and shall share
//                  any locks. The FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with the new file descriptor shall be
//                  cleared to keep the file open across calls to one of the exec functions.
//
//      F_GETFD
//                  Get the file descriptor flags defined in <fcntl.h> that are associated
//                  with the file descriptor fildes. File descriptor flags are associated
//                  with a single file descriptor and do not affect other file descriptors
//                  that refer to the same file.
//
//      F_SETFD
//                  Set the file descriptor flags defined in <fcntl.h>, that are associated
//                  with fildes, to the third argument, arg, taken as type int. If the
//                  FD_CLOEXEC flag in the third argument is 0, the file shall remain open
//                  across the exec functions; otherwise, the file shall be closed upon
//                  successful execution of one of the exec functions.
//
//      F_GETFL
//                  Get the file status flags and file access modes, defined in <fcntl.h>,
//                  for the file description associated with fildes. The file access modes
//                  can be extracted from the return value using the mask O_ACCMODE, which
//                  is defined in <fcntl.h>. File status flags and file access modes are
//                  associated with the file description and do not affect other file
//                  descriptors that refer to the same file with different open file
//                  descriptions.
//
//      F_SETFL
//                  Set the file status flags, defined in <fcntl.h>, for the file
//                  description associated with fildes from the corresponding bits in the
//                  third argument, arg, taken as type int. Bits corresponding to the file
//                  access mode and the file creation flags, as defined in <fcntl.h>, that
//                  are set in arg shall be ignored. If any bits in arg other than those
//                  mentioned here are changed by the application, the result is unspecified.
//
//      F_GETOWN
//                  If fildes refers to a socket, get the process or process group ID
//                  specified to receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available.
//                  Positive values indicate a process ID; negative values, other than -1,
//                  indicate a process group ID. If fildes does not refer to a socket, the
//                  results are unspecified.
//
//      F_SETOWN
//                  If fildes refers to a socket, set the process or process group ID
//                  specified to receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available,
//                  using the value of the third argument, arg, taken as type int. Positive
//                  values indicate a process ID; negative values, other than -1, indicate
//                  a process group ID. If fildes does not refer to a socket, the results
//                  are unspecified.
//
//      The following values for cmd are available for advisory record locking. Record
//      locking shall be supported for regular files, and may be supported for other files.
//
//      F_GETLK     Get the first lock which blocks the lock description pointed to by the
//                  third argument, arg, taken as a pointer to type struct flock, defined
//                  in <fcntl.h>. The information retrieved shall overwrite the information
//                  passed to fcntl() in the structure flock. If no lock is found that
//                  would prevent this lock from being created, then the structure shall be
//                  left unchanged except for the lock type which shall be set to F_UNLCK.
//
//      F_SETLK     Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock description
//                  pointed to by the third argument, arg, taken as a pointer to type
//                  struct flock, defined in <fcntl.h>. F_SETLK can establish shared (or
//                  read) locks (F_RDLCK) or exclusive (or write) locks (F_WRLCK), as well
//                  as to remove either type of lock (F_UNLCK). F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, and
//                  F_UNLCK are defined in <fcntl.h>. If a shared or exclusive lock cannot
//                  be set, fcntl() shall return immediately with a return value of -1.
//
//      F_SETLKW    This command shall be equivalent to F_SETLK except that if a shared or
//                  exclusive lock is blocked by other locks, the thread shall wait until
//                  the request can be satisfied. If a signal that is to be caught is
//                  received while fcntl() is waiting for a region, fcntl() shall be
//                  interrupted. Upon return from the signal handler, fcntl() shall return
//                  -1 with errno set to [EINTR], and the lock operation shall not be done.
//
//      Additional implementation-defined values for cmd may be defined in <fcntl.h>. Their
//      names shall start with F_.
//
//      When a shared lock is set on a segment of a file, other processes shall be able to
//      set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it. A shared lock prevents any
//      other process from setting an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area.
//      A request for a shared lock shall fail if the file descriptor was not opened with
//      read access.
//
//      An exclusive lock shall prevent any other process from setting a shared lock or an
//      exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area. A request for an exclusive
//      lock shall fail if the file descriptor was not opened with write access.
//
//      The structure flock describes the type ( l_type), starting offset ( l_whence),
//      relative offset ( l_start), size ( l_len), and process ID ( l_pid) of the segment
//      of the file to be affected.
//
//      The value of l_whence is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to indicate that the
//      relative offset l_start bytes shall be measured from the start of the file, current
//      position, or end of the file, respectively. The value of l_len is the number of
//      consecutive bytes to be locked. The value of l_len may be negative (where the
//      definition of off_t permits negative values of l_len). The l_pid field is only used
//      with F_GETLK to return the process ID of the process holding a blocking lock. After
//      a successful F_GETLK request, when a blocking lock is found, the values returned in
//      the flock structure shall be as follows:
//
//          l_type          Type of blocking lock found.
//
//          l_whence        SEEK_SET.
//
//          l_start         Start of the blocking lock.
//
//          l_len           Length of the blocking lock.
//
//          l_pid           Process ID of the process that holds the blocking lock.
//
//      If the command is F_SETLKW and the process must wait for another process to release
//      a lock, then the range of bytes to be locked shall be determined before the fcntl()
//      function blocks. If the file size or file descriptor seek offset change while
//      fcntl() is blocked, this shall not affect the range of bytes locked.
//
//      If l_len is positive, the area affected shall start at l_start and end at l_start+
//      l_len-1. If l_len is negative, the area affected shall start at l_start+ l_len and
//      end at l_start-1. Locks may start and extend beyond the current end of a file, but
//      shall not extend before the beginning of the file. A lock shall be set to extend to
//      the largest possible value of the file offset for that file by setting l_len to 0.
//      If such a lock also has l_start set to 0 and l_whence is set to SEEK_SET, the whole
//      file shall be locked.
//
//      There shall be at most one type of lock set for each byte in the file. Before a
//      successful return from an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request when the calling process
//      has previously existing locks on bytes in the region specified by the request, the
//      previous lock type for each byte in the specified region shall be replaced by the
//      new lock type. As specified above under the descriptions of shared locks and
//      exclusive locks, an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request (respectively) shall fail or
//      block when another process has existing locks on bytes in the specified region and
//      the type of any of those locks conflicts with the type specified in the request.
//
//      All locks associated with a file for a given process shall be removed when a file
//      descriptor for that file is closed by that process or the process holding that file
//      descriptor terminates. Locks are not inherited by a child process.
//
//      A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked region is put to
//      sleep by attempting to lock another process' locked region. If the system detects
//      that sleeping until a locked region is unlocked would cause a deadlock, fcntl()
//      shall fail with an [EDEADLK] error.
//
//      An unlock (F_UNLCK) request in which l_len is non-zero and the offset of the last
//      byte of the requested segment is the maximum value for an object of type off_t,
//      when the process has an existing lock in which l_len is 0 and which includes the
//      last byte of the requested segment, shall be treated as a request to unlock from
//      the start of the requested segment with an l_len equal to 0. Otherwise, an unlock
//      (F_UNLCK) request shall attempt to unlock only the requested segment.
//
//      When the file descriptor fildes refers to a shared memory object, the behavior of
//      fcntl() shall be the same as for a regular file except the effect of the following
//      values for the argument cmd shall be unspecified: F_SETFL, F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and
//      F_SETLKW. [Option End]
//
//      If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the fcntl() function is
//      unspecified. [Option End]
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon successful completion, the value returned shall depend on cmd as follows:
//
//      F_DUPFD
//          A new file descriptor.
//      F_GETFD
//          Value of flags defined in <fcntl.h>. The return value shall not be negative.
//      F_SETFD
//          Value other than -1.
//      F_GETFL
//          Value of file status flags and access modes. The return value is not negative.
//      F_SETFL
//          Value other than -1.
//      F_GETLK
//          Value other than -1.
//      F_SETLK
//          Value other than -1.
//      F_SETLKW
//          Value other than -1.
//      F_GETOWN
//          Value of the socket owner process or process group; this will not be -1.
//      F_SETOWN
//          Value other than -1.
//
//      Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      The fcntl() function shall fail if:
//
//      [EACCES] or [EAGAIN]
//          The cmd argument is F_SETLK; the type of lock ( l_type) is a shared (F_RDLCK)
//          or exclusive (F_WRLCK) lock and the segment of a file to be locked is already
//          exclusive-locked by another process, or the type is an exclusive lock and some
//          portion of the segment of a file to be locked is already shared-locked or
//          exclusive-locked by another process.
//
//      [EBADF]
//          The fildes argument is not a valid open file descriptor, or the argument cmd is
//          F_SETLK or F_SETLKW, the type of lock, l_type, is a shared lock (F_RDLCK), and
//          fildes is not a valid file descriptor open for reading, or the type of lock,
//          l_type, is an exclusive lock (F_WRLCK), and fildes is not a valid file
//          descriptor open for writing.
//
//      [EINTR]
//          The cmd argument is F_SETLKW and the function was interrupted by a signal.
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The cmd argument is invalid, or the cmd argument is F_DUPFD and arg is negative
//          or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}, or the cmd argument is F_GETLK, F_SETLK,
//          or F_SETLKW and the data pointed to by arg is not valid, or fildes refers to a
//          file that does not support locking.
//
//      [EMFILE]
//          The argument cmd is F_DUPFD and {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open
//          in the calling process, or no file descriptors greater than or equal to arg are
//          available.
//
//      [ENOLCK]
//          The argument cmd is F_SETLK or F_SETLKW and satisfying the lock or unlock
//          request would result in the number of locked regions in the system exceeding a
//          system-imposed limit.
//
//      [EOVERFLOW]
//          One of the values to be returned cannot be represented correctly.
//
//      [EOVERFLOW]
//          The cmd argument is F_GETLK, F_SETLK, or F_SETLKW and the smallest or, if l_len
//          is non-zero, the largest offset of any byte in the requested segment cannot be
//          represented correctly in an object of type off_t.
//
//      The fcntl() function may fail if:
//
//      [EDEADLK]
//          The cmd argument is F_SETLKW, the lock is blocked by a lock from another
//          process, and putting the calling process to sleep to wait for that lock to
//          become free would cause a deadlock.
