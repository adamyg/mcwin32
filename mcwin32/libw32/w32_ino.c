/*
 *  w32_ino_gen ---
 *      Generate a file-name inode based on specific file index.
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *
 *      The identifier (low and high parts) and the volume serial number uniquely
 *      identify a file on a single computer. To determine whether two open handles
 *      represent the same file, combine the identifier and the volume serial
 *      number for each file and compare them.
 *
 *      The identifier that is stored in the nFileIndexHigh and nFileIndexLow members
 *      is called the file ID. Support for file IDs is file system-specific. File IDs
 *      are not guaranteed to be unique over time, because file systems are free to
 *      reuse them. In some cases, the file ID for a file can change over time.
 *
 *      In the FAT file system, the file ID is generated from the first cluster of the
 *      containing directory and the byte offset within the directory of the entry for
 *      the file. Some defragmentation products change this byte offset. (Windows
 *      in-box defragmentation does not.) Thus, a FAT file ID can change over time.
 *      Renaming a file in the FAT file system can also change the file ID, but only if
 *      the new file name is longer than the old one.
 *
 *      In the NTFS file system, a file keeps the same file ID until it is deleted. You
 *      can replace one file with another file without changing the file ID by using
 *      the ReplaceFile function. However, the file ID of the replacement file, not the
 *      replaced file, is retained as the file ID of the resulting file.
