//  NAME
//
//      poll - input/output multiplexing
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//
//      #include <<poll.h>
//      int poll(struct pollfd fds[], nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//
//      The poll() function provides applications with a mechanism for multiplexing
//      input/output over a set of file descriptors. For each member of the array
//      pointed to by fds, poll() examines the given file descriptor for the event(s)
//      specified in events. The number of pollfd structures in the fds array is
//      specified by nfds. The poll() function identifies those file descriptors on
//      which an application can read or write data, or on which certain events have
//      occurred.
//
//      The fds argument specifies the file descriptors to be examined and the events
//      of interest for each file descriptor. It is a pointer to an array with one
//      member for each open file descriptor of interest. The array`s members are
//      pollfd structures within which fd specifies an open file descriptor and events
//      and revents are bitmasks constructed by OR-ing a combination of the following
//      event flags:
//
//      POLLIN
//          Data other than high-priority data may be read without blocking. For
//          STREAMS, this flag is set in revents even if the message is of zero length.
//
//      POLLRDNORM
//          Normal data (priority band equals 0) may be read without blocking. For
//          STREAMS, this flag is set in revents even if the message is of zero length.
//
//      POLLRDBAND
//          Data from a non-zero priority band may be read without blocking. For
//          STREAMS, this flag is set in revents even if the message is of zero length.
//
//      POLLPRI
//          High-priority data may be received without blocking. For STREAMS, this flag
//          is set in revents even if the message is of zero length.
//
//      POLLOUT
//          Normal data (priority band equals 0) may be written without blocking.
//
//      POLLWRNORM
//          Same as POLLOUT.
//
//      POLLWRBAND
//          Priority data (priority band > 0) may be written. If any priority band has
//          been written to on this STREAM, this event only examines bands that have
//          been written to at least once.
//
//      POLLERR
//          An error has occurred on the device or stream. This flag is only valid in
//          the revents bitmask; it is ignored in the events member.
//
//      POLLHUP
//          The device has been disconnected. This event and POLLOUT are mutually
//          exclusive; a stream can never be writable if a hangup has occurred. However,
//          this event and POLLIN, POLLRDNORM, POLLRDBAND or POLLPRI are not mutually
//          exclusive. This flag is only valid in the revents bitmask; it is ignored in
//          the events member.
//
//      POLLNVAL
//          The specified fd value is invalid. This flag is only valid in the revents
//          member; it is ignored in the events member.
//
//      If the value of fd is less than 0, events is ignored and revents is set to 0 in
//      that entry on return from poll().
//
//      In each pollfd structure, poll() clears the revents member except that where
//      the application requested a report on a condition by setting one of the bits of
//      events listed above, poll() sets the corresponding bit in revents if the
//      requested condition is true. In addition, poll() sets the POLLHUP, POLLERR and
//      POLLNVAL flag in revents if the condition is true, even if the application did
//      not set the corresponding bit in events.
//
//      If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected file descriptor,
//      poll() waits at least timeout milliseconds for an event to occur on any of the
//      selected file descriptors. If the value of timeout is 0, poll() returns
//      immediately. If the value of timeout is -1, poll() blocks until a requested
//      event occurs or until the call is interrupted.
//
//      Implementations may place limitations on the granularity of timeout intervals.
//      If the requested timeout interval requires a finer granularity than the
//      implementation supports, the actual timeout interval will be rounded up to the
//      next supported value.
//
//      The poll() function is not affected by the O_NONBLOCK flag.
//
//      The poll() function supports regular files, terminal and pseudo-terminal
//      devices, STREAMS-based files, FIFOs and pipes. The behaviour of poll() on
//      elements of fds that refer to other types of file is unspecified.
//
//      Regular files always poll TRUE for reading and writing.
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon successful completion, poll() returns a non-negative value. A positive
//      value indicates the total number of file descriptors that have been selected
//      (that is, file descriptors for which the revents member is non-zero). A value
//      of 0 indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors have been
//      selected. Upon failure, poll() returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.
//
//    ERRORS
//
//      The poll() function will fail if:
//
//      [EAGAIN]
//          The allocation of internal data structures failed but a subsequent request
//          may succeed.
//
//      [EINTR]
//          A signal was caught during poll().
//
//      [EINVAL]
//          The nfds argument is greater than {OPEN_MAX}, or one of the fd members
//          refers to a STREAM or multiplexer that is linked (directly or indirectly)
//          downstream from a multiplexer.
