/*
//  NAME
//      sleep - suspend execution for an interval of time
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//      #include <unistd.h>
//
//      unsigned sleep(unsigned seconds);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//      The sleep() function shall cause the calling thread to be suspended from execution
//      until either the number of realtime seconds specified by the argument seconds has
//      elapsed or a signal is delivered to the calling thread and its action is to invoke
//      a signal-catching function or to terminate the process. The suspension time may be
//      longer than requested due to the scheduling of other activity by the system.
//
//      If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during execution of
//      sleep() and if the SIGALRM signal is being ignored or blocked from delivery, it is
//      unspecified whether sleep() returns when the SIGALRM signal is scheduled. If the
//      signal is being blocked, it is also unspecified whether it remains pending after
//      sleep() returns or it is discarded.
//
//      If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during execution of
//      sleep(), except as a result of a prior call to alarm(), and if the SIGALRM signal
//      is not being ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether that
//      signal has any effect other than causing sleep() to return.
//
//      If a signal-catching function interrupts sleep() and examines or changes either the
//      time a SIGALRM is scheduled to be generated, the action associated with the SIGALRM
//      signal, or whether the SIGALRM signal is blocked from delivery, the results are
//      unspecified.
//
//      If a signal-catching function interrupts sleep() and calls siglongjmp() or
//      longjmp() to restore an environment saved prior to the sleep() call, the action
//      associated with the SIGALRM signal and the time at which a SIGALRM signal is
//      scheduled to be generated are unspecified. It is also unspecified whether the
//      SIGALRM signal is blocked, unless the process' signal mask is restored as part of
//      the environment.
//
//      Interactions between sleep() and any of setitimer(), ualarm(), or usleep() are
//      unspecified.
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//      If sleep() returns because the requested time has elapsed, the value returned shall
//      be 0. If sleep() returns due to delivery of a signal, the return value shall be the
//      "unslept" amount (the requested time minus the time actually slept) in seconds.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      No errors are defined.

/*
//  NAME
//
//      utime - set file access and modification times
//
//  SYNOPSIS
//
//      #include <utime.h>
//
//      int utime(const char *path, const struct utimbuf *times);
//
//  DESCRIPTION
//
//      The  utime()  function  shall  set  the  access  and modification
//      times of the file named by the path argument.
//
//      If  times  is  a  null pointer, the access and modification times
//      of  the  file  shall  be  set  to the current time. The effective
//      user  ID  of  the  process  shall match the owner of the file, or
//      the  process  has write permission to the file or has appropriate
//      privileges, to use utime() in this manner.
//
//      If  times  is not a null pointer, times shall be interpreted as a
//      pointer  to  a  utimbuf structure and the access and modification
//      times  shall  be  set  to  the values contained in the designated
//      structure.  Only  a  process  with the effective user ID equal to
//      the   user   ID  of  the  file  or  a  process  with  appropriate
//      privileges may use utime() this way.
//
//      The  utimbuf  structure  is  defined in the <utime.h> header. The
//      times  in  the  structure  utimbuf  are measured in seconds since
//      the Epoch.
//
//      Upon  successful  completion,  utime() shall mark the time of the
//      last   file   status  change,   st_ctime,   to  be  updated;  see
//      <sys/stat.h>.
//
//  RETURN VALUE
//
//      Upon  successful  completion,  0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
//      shall  be  returned and errno shall be set to indicate the error,
//      and the file times shall not be affected.
//
//  ERRORS
//
//      The utime() function shall fail if:
//
//      [EACCES]
//          Search  permission  is  denied  by  a  component  of the path
//          prefix;  or  the  times  argument  is  a null pointer and the
//          effective  user  ID  of  the process does not match the owner
//          of  the  file, the process does not have write permission for
//          the   file,   and  the  process  does  not  have  appropriate
//          privileges.
//
//      [ELOOP]
//          A   loop   exists   in   symbolic  links  encountered  during
//          resolution of the path argument.
//
//      [ENAMETOOLONG]
//          The  length  of  the  path  argument  exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a
//          pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
//
//      [ENOENT]
//          A  component  of  path does not name an existing file or path
//          is an empty string.
//
//      [ENOTDIR]
//          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
//
//      [EPERM]
//          The  times  argument  is  not  a null pointer and the calling
//          process'  effective  user  ID does not match the owner of the
//          file  and  the  calling process does not have the appropriate
//          privileges.
//
//      [EROFS]
//          The file system containing the file is read-only.
//
//      The utime() function may fail if:
//
//      [ELOOP]
//          More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX}  symbolic  links  were  encountered
//          during resolution of the path argument.
//
//      [ENAMETOOLONG]
//          As  a  result  of  encountering a symbolic link in resolution
//          of   the  path  argument,   the  length  of  the  substituted
