Build requirements for GNU Midnight Commander
----------------------------------------------------

   The following external requirements/packages need to be available

        - busybox-win32
        - glib2 (pre build 201)
        - make / binutils
        - perl
        - supported compiler tool-chain
        - Inno


Installation instructions for GNU Midnight Commander
----------------------------------------------------

    To compile this package:

        1. Install the required packages,

                Confirm/update as required the installation paths with the
                ./win32/Makefile

                        GTKINSTALL - base path of the glib installation.


                Other components are assumed to be within the current active
                PATH, including

                        perl, make, busybox, compiler, rc


                Modify either Makefile and/or Makefile.common as needed.


        2. 'make all' within the win32 source tree ./win32

        3. mc-win32-setup.exe


Obtaining related software
----------------------------------------------------

   o busybox-win32

        Busybox is utilised both during make operations, plus is packaged
        with the Midnight commander setup for run-time execution by the shell
        sub-system of unix style scripts, for example by the internal vfs
        implementation (i.e. gz decompression).

        BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
        single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most
        of the utilities you usually find in bzip2, coreutils, dhcp, 
        diffutils, e2fsprogs, file, findutils, gawk, grep, inetutils, less, 
        modutils, net-tools, procps, sed, shadow, sysklogd, sysvinit, tar, 
        util-linux, and vim. The utilities in BusyBox often have fewer
        options than their full-featured cousins; however, the options that
        are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much
        like their larger counterparts.

        The current distribution is available from

                https://github.com/pclouds/busybox-w32

   o glib - pre build 201

        The only "hard" dependency of GNU Midnight Commander is glib

        Minimal version of glib: 2.8.x
        Recommended version: 2.14.x and higher.

        Newer versions may work, but haven't been tested.

        You can get glib from

                ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/glib/

        or use the current pre-build win23 packages available from

                https://live.gnome.org/GTK+/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack

        at present only the following components are required

                intl.dll
                libglib-2.0-0.dll

   o make / binutils

        You can retrieve the required system applications from

                http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html

        the best installation solution is thru the getgnuwin32, which is an
        "Automated gnuwin32 download tool", available at

                http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/


   o perl

        A local perl installation is required during the build process.

        ActivePerl is the leading commercial-grade distribution of the open source Perl
        scripting language. Download ActivePerl Community Edition free binaries for
        your development projects and internal deployments.

        You can retrieve the required installation packages from

                http://www.activestate.com/


   o compiler

        Currently tested against the following tool chains

                o Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9

                o Microsoft Visual Studio C/C++ 2013 (or greater)


   o inno

        Inno Setup is a free installer for Windows programs. First introduced
        in 1997, Inno Setup today rivals and even surpasses many commercial
        installers in feature set and stability.
