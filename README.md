# Midnight Commander for Windows

## Native Midnight Commander 4.8.33 for Windows/Win32

Windows XP+/32 bit native port of GNU Midnight Commander, based on the [4.8.33](https://midnight-commander.org/wiki/NEWS-4.8.33) release.

Supports recent Windows 10/11 distributions, both MsTerminal and legacy console, 16 and 256 colour modes are available within all.

Midnight Commander (also known as mc) is a free cross-platform orthodox file manager and a clone of Norton Commander.

Features include the ability work with common archive formats as if they were simply another directory, and to function as an SFTP/FTP client.
Midnight Commander also includes an built-in editor/viewer, features include syntax highlighting for many languages, macros, code snippets, 
simple integration with external tools, automatic indentation, mouse support, clipboard and the ability to work in both ASCII and hex modes.

Midnight Commander supports accessing remote filesystems through several methods, including SSHâ€™s Secure File Transfer Protocol, SFTP. 
This is in addition to FISH, using either a SSH client or legacy RSH connections. This way you can easily transfer files between servers.

Midnight Commander can also rename groups of files, move files to a different directory at the same time as it renames them. 
It lets the user specify the original and resulting file names using wildcard characters.


## Examples

Main panels.

### Command view.

Optional command view mode, available as a layout option when no sub-shell is active/available.
Functionality is a reproduction of the original *Ctrl-O* _no-panel_ mode of Norton Commander.

## Installation

Recent distributions are now bundled with an installer, the following shall prompt and then check for available upgrades.
Note: Automatic checks wont occur at this time; functionality staged for a later release.

```
mcupdater force
```

Updating older distribution shall require you download from one of the sites listed below or alternatively winget and then update if requried.

```
winget install --id=GNU.MidnightCommander -e
```

To utilise *Files transferred over Shell protocol* **(FISH)** over SSH, an ssh client is required, you can either install [Win32-OpenSSH](https://github.com/powershell/Win32-OpenSSH) or [WinXSH](https://github.com/adamyg/winxsh).  For legacy RSH based connections [WinXSH](https://github.com/adamyg/winxsh) is needed.

Finally the internal editor has built-in spell enabled. To utilise aspell is required, you can optionally install [Win32-Aspell](https://github.com/adamyg/aspell-win32).


## Documentation

The primary way to learn about midnight-commander is to use the context-sensitive online help available via **F1**.

![](mcwin32/art/sample06.png?raw=true)

Comprehensive manual pages serve as the main source of official documentation. These pages cover topics such as "mc," "mcdiff," "mcedit," and "mcview," which can be accessed through the **mchelp** utility. This utility presents relevant information on each topic using the internal viewer of _Midnight Commander_.

```
mchelp mc
```

## Configuration

### Run-time profile

The location of run-time configuration elements will differ across installations, and this can be checked using the ```--datadir-info``` option. Additionally, these elements are influenced by the MC_DATADIR environment variable. Further details can be found in __mchelp mc__.


```
$ mc --datadir-info

### Extensions

Midnight Commander is fully extendable, allowing operations bound to file extensions. 

Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an  executable  program; and if the extension file has a program    specified for the file's extension, the specified program is executed. See [EXTENSIONS](mcwin32/doc/EXTENSIONS.md) for a number of  suitable examples.
