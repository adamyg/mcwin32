# Midnight Commander for Windows

## Native Midnight Commander 4.8.27 for Windows/Win32

	Windows XP+/32 bit native port of GNU Midnight Commander,
	based on the current 4.8.27 development stream.

	Supports both the recent Windows 10 plus the prior legacy console,
	16 and 256 colour modes are available within either.

	Midnight Commander (also known as mc) is a free cross-platform orthodox file manager
	and a clone of Norton Commander.

	Features include the ability work with common archive formats as if they were simply another
	directory, and to function as an SFTP/FTP client. Midnight Commander also includes an builtin
	editor/viewer, features include syntax highlighting for many languages, macros, code snippets, 
	simple integration with external tools, automatic indentation, mouse support, clipboard and
	the ability to work in both ASCII and hex modes.

	Midnight Commander can also rename groups of files, move files to a different directory at the 
	same time as it renames them. It lets the user specify the original and resulting file names
	using wildcard characters.
